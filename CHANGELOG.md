## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-24

### Changed

- **Rebranding: RoyalBit to Möllendorff AI**
  - Updated crate name from `royalbit-forge-e2e-r` to `mollendorff-forge-e2e-r`
  - **Why rebrand?** The "RoyalBit" name (company founded 2006) was hijacked by unrelated cryptocurrency scammers:
    - UK FCA issued official warning (Oct 2024) about "Royalbit Miners" - unauthorized firm
    - Multiple fraudulent domains: royalbit.ltd (trust score 38/100), royalbit.top, royal-bit.club
    - Classic HYIP Ponzi schemes offering impossible returns (155-580% in days)
    - Sources: [FCA Warning](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/royalbit-miners), [Scam Detector](https://www.scam-detector.com/validator/royalbit-ltd-review/)

### Philosophy

**Forge is NEVER the authority.**
All tests validate forge against R, the gold-standard for statistical computing.
If forge disagrees with R, forge has a bug.
